### Usenet Bundle

The Usenet Bundle is a complete set of DroboApps for the Drobo5N to automate and manage downloads from Usenet.

The only pre-requisite is [Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/app-repository/python2). Python is the interpreter for the language in which the other apps are written. You need to install it before the other apps.

The first item of the bundle is [SABnzbd]({{ site.baseurl }}/app-repository/sabnzbd). SABnzbd is the download manager. The other apps use it to download whatever needs downloading.

The second item of the bundle is [SickBeard]({{ site.baseurl }}/app-repository/sickbeard). SickBeard manages and organizes TV series downloads.

The third item of the bundle is [CouchPotato]({{ site.baseurl }}/app-repository/couchpotato). CouchPotato manages and organizes movie downloads.

The fourth item of the bundle is [Headphones]({{ site.baseurl }}/app-repository/headphones). Headphones manages and organizes music downloads.

SickBeard, CouchPotato, and Headphones are independent of each other, and can be installed as-needed.

For more information about configuring each of these apps, please check their respective websites, or consult [HTPC guides](http://www.htpcguides.com/category/usenet/).
